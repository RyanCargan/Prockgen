# Prockgen

This is the code and example .blend file from my talk at GCAP 2018, "Procedural Generation by Automating Blender". It demonstrates how to procedurally generate and texture meshes through Blender's Python API.

## How to use it:

1. Download Blender.
2. Open 'GCAP 2018.blend'.
3. In the Text Editor pane, select the file 'asteroid_complete.py'.
4. Click Run script. It will generate, texture and export an asteroid into 'Procgen/Assets'.

The 'scripts' folder contains all of the code I demonstrated on stage. 'scripts/asteroid_complete.py' is probably the most interesting, and is fully commented.

'util.py' contains some helper functions that weren't particularly relevant to the talk's topic.
